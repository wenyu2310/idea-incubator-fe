## Background
In our diverse workplaces (corporate & public statboard), we've noticed a shift toward innovation-focused, consultative cultures. However, most companies still rely on annual innovation calls, creating engagement bottlenecks and limiting continuous collaboration.
We envisioned a digital platform where employees can post innovative ideas in secure internal databases, receive peer feedback, and benefit from company-wide voting. This approach not only streamlines prioritization but transforms innovation from an occasional exercise into an ongoing practice.
Our 'Ideas Incubation' platform democratizes the ideation process, ensuring valuable insights from all organizational levels gain visibility and support. By creating this dedicated innovation hub, we're enabling the transparent, collaborative culture that modern businesses and public governance need to thrive.

## Project Brief
This Company Ideas Incubator Tool aims to foster a culture of innovation and collaboration in the company. The tool will provide a platform for
1. Proposals Sharing - Easily submit and share innovative ideas with colleagues.
2. Feedback Collection- Gather constructive feedback to refine and improve concepts.
3. Voting & Prioritization- Identify top ideas through voting and prioritization.the updated information and any changes to design, timeline and upcoming engagement sessions.

# UserStories 
- As a user I would like to sign up and create an account
- As a user I would like to log in securely 
- As a user I would like to post Ideas under my name
- As a user I would like to edit or delete my Idea
- As a user I would like to like other Ideas 
- As a user I would like to see the top liked Idea float to the top of the page (stretched goal)

## Models
User model
Idea model 
Reaction/voting model
Comments model

## MVP- Minimum Viable Product
1. At least 3 data entities components
2. The back-end application is built with Express and Node.
3. MongoDB is used as the database management system.
4. The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users.
5. Authorization is implemented across the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
6. The project has at least two data entities in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
7. The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.
8. The front-end application does not hold any secret keys. Public APIs that require secret keys must be accessed from the back-end application.

## Planned future enhancements
- Ideas - Post documents / images
- Anaylsis of number of Ideas over time

## Reflections
- Strengths: Mastered Express CRUD operations and developed effective full-stack teamwork.
- Weaknesses: Unclear initial data models and underestimated task complexity.

## additional reflections 
- familiarize with CRUD concepts and basic REACT components for backend + frontend deployment
- communication and coordination played a big role, especially with time constraint and technical complexity
